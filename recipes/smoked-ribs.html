        <p>This recipe will help you create a wonderful and delicious pull pork bbq that can be used to make sandwiches, casorols, and many more.</p>
        <p>In this recipe I will be giving you my personal spice rub, but you all are more than welcome to alter it to your liking. I will also make sure to give you the instructions on how to prepare, how to cook, and what you need to do after the cook.</p>
        <p><strong>Spice Rub</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup of Paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of Salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of Sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of Granulated Garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of Granulated Onion</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of Chili</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of Cumin</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons of Fresh Cracked Peppper</li>
            <li>2 Tablesppons of Dry Mustard</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon of Cayenne Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Prep Process, this should be done the day before the cook.</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>You want to cover your ribs with a binder, I like to use mustard but other use siracha, hot sauce, ect...</li>
            <li>After putting the binder on make sure to put your spice rub evenly.</li>
            <li>Cover the ribs lightly with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge until cook day.</li>
            <li>Pull the ribs out from the fridge about 1 hour before the cook.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Cook Day</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose your choice of wood, I like to use apple, but any classic wood like hickory or mesquite. Don't be afraid to experiment and try other woods out. </li>
            <li>Get your grill up to 250 and place the ribs inside your smoker.</li>
            <li>While your ribs is being smoked grab a spray bottle and make sure its clean and fill it up with some liquids. It can be water, beer, apple juice, or apple cider. You can also do a jack and coke as well. The liquid being sprayed on helps with holding on the smoke.</li>
            <li>When cooking, you want the final temp to be around 200.</li>
            <li>I like to spray about ever 45 mins but after cooking for awhile you will figure out what works best for you.</li>
            <li>For me my ribs usually take me about 4 hours to smoke at 250, I cook 2 hours unwraped, and 2 hours wrapped with aluminium.</li>
            <li>When wraping I add butter, honey, and brown sugar to help tenderize it.</li>
            <li>Once when it reach the 205 temp take it out let it rest for about 30 mins and dig in.</li>
        </ol>
